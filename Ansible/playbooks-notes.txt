1.Playbooks
- set of tasks to execute on a target machine
- To execute a Playbook i.e
ansible-playbook -i <hosts file> <playbook file> eg
ansible-playbook -i hosts playbook.yaml

2. Idempotency
- Ansible compares Actual state vs Desired state.

3. Collections vs Modules in Ansible || Module index vs Collection index
- Collection: packaging format for building and distributing Ansible content
- can be released and installed independent of other Collections.
- as of 2.10, all modules were grouped into Collections.
- To list available Collections:
ansible-galaxy collection list 
- Ansible Galaxy --> hub for storing Ansible Collections.

4. Ansible plugins
- pieces of code that add to Ansible's functionality or modules.
- You can also write your own Plugins.


NB:
- To check whether a service is running:
ps aux | grep <service-name> eg
ps aux | grep nginx
- To check nginx version
nginx -v
- For ansible version 2.9 and earlier, all modules were included in the 
ansible distribution that you install.
- as for Ansible version 2.10, modules and plugins moved into various "Collections"
so Ansible was divided into two
i) Ansible code - ansible base package
contains the core Ansible programs
ii) Ansible module and Plugins
