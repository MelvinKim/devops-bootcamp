Ansible
1. Host file
- File containing data about the Ansible client servers
- Tells Ansible the IP Addresses of the server it has to manage.
- "hosts" - meaning the managed servers
- default location: /etc/ansible/hosts
- sample host file contents
(Ansible uses the PRIVATE KEY not public key)
134.56.78.99 ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa ansible_user=ubuntu
134.50.78.90 ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa ansible_user=ubuntu

2. Ansible ad-hoc commands
- provides a faster way to interact with the desired servers
- ad-hoc commands pattern
ansible <pattern> -m <module> -a "<module options>"
eg ansible all -i hosts -m ping 
all --> target all servers
hosts --> target inventory
ping --> ping module

3. Grouping servers in a hosts file
- NB: one host can belong to more than group.
[database]
134.56.78.99
134.56.70.90

[database:vars]
ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa
ansible_user=root

[web_servers]
12.45.78.99
34.56.70.90

[web_servers:vars]
ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa
ansible_user=root

[ec2]
ec2-15-190-239-1.eu-west-3.compute.amazonaws.com
ec2-15-188-239-5.eu-west-3.compute.amazonaws.com ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3

[ec2:vars]
ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/Downloads/ansible.pem (remember to do: "chmod 400 ~/Downloads/ansible.pem")
ansible_user=ec2
ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3

- To target only the database group
ansible database -i hosts -m ping
- To target only the web_servers group
ansible web_servers -i hosts -m ping
- To target only the ec2 group
ansible ec2 -i hosts -m ping
- To target a specific server
ansible 172.34.56.90 -i hosts -m ping
- To override the default python interpreter
ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3

4. Authorized Keys and Known Hosts 
- known hosts --> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
- To add an entry about a specific server to the known hosts file:
ssh-keyscan -H <ip-address> >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts eg
ssh-keyscan -H 165.22.201.197 >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
ssh-keyscan -H 188.166.30.219 >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
- For a remote server to authenticate the local machine:
1. The target remote server has to have the public ssh key.
- To copy an ssh public key to a remote host
ssh-copy-id root@188.166.30.219
ssh-copy-id root@190.168.30.219
- To disable Host key checking
1. Mostly suited for Ephemeral Infrastructure: servers are dynamically created and destroyed.
2. default ansible configuration location --> ~/.ansible.cfg  || /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
To disable host key checking in the ansible.cfg file: 
[defaults]
host_key_checking = False
