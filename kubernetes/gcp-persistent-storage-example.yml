# Persistent Volumes are not namespaced.
# Persistent Volume Claims must exist in the same namespace with the pods.

# a pod can actually use multiple volumes types simutaneously
# for instance: an application that needs a configuration file mounted though a configMap, needs a tls certificate mounted as 
# a secret, database storage etc
