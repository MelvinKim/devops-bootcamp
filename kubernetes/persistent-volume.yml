# Persistent Volumes are not namespaced.
# Persistent Volume Claims must exist in the same namespace with the pods.

# a pod can actually use multiple volumes types simutaneously
# for instance: an application that needs a configuration file mounted though a configMap, needs a tls certificate mounted as 
# a secret, database storage etc

# <dir-path> - replaces with the actual directory path
#  <server-ip> - replace with the server ip address
